 * Use Meshgrid for mask shape using the ellipse.
 *
 * Per "classical" ellipse theory, the major-axis is the longer of the two.
 * For example, for an image/mask that is wider than higher, the x-axis is
 * the major-axis and the y-axis is the minor axis.
 * This is the ellipse formula:  `x^2/a^2  +  y^2/b^2  = 1   when a > b`
 *
 * However, using the meshgrid technique, there is no need to keep track of
 * major/minor axes.
 *
 * Scale the meshgrid arrays by the ellipse horizontal (a) and vertical (b)
 * vertices.  The vertices are one-half the width and height of the
 * 2-dimensional mask (where the mask is same cv::Size as the padded source
 * image).
 *
 * Calculate the magnitude of the scaled meshgrids using cv::magnitude(a,b).
 * It is this `meshgridScaledMagnitude' array that is "traversed" and "checked"
 * against a "distance" -OR- cut-off frequency.
 *
 * Save filter/mask to instance variable.
 *
 * @param mask_size `width` x `height` that is same size as image to resample
